                <p>I'm getting older</p> 
                <p>I think I'm aging well</p> 
                
                <p>I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself</p> 
                <p>There's reasons that I'm thankful</p> 
                <p>There's a lot I'm grateful for</p> 
                <p>But it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door</p>
                <p>'cause the strangers seem to want me more than anyone before</p>
                <p>anyone before</p>
                <p>too bad they're usually deranged.</p>

                <p>Last week I realized I crave pity</p>
                <p>When I re-tell a story</p>
                <p>I make everything sound worse</p>
