                <p>I'm getting older</p> 
                <p>I think I'm aging well</p> 
                <p>I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself</p> 

                <p>There's reasons that I'm thankful</p> 
                <p>there's a lot I'm grateful for</p> 
                <p>but it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door</p>
                <p>'cause the strangers seem to want me more than anyone before</p>
                <p>anyone before</p>
                <p>too bad they're usually deranged.</p>

                <p>Last week I realized I crave pity</p>
                <p>when I re-tell a story</p>
                <p>I make everything sound worse</p>

                <p>Can't shake the feeling</p>
                <p>that I'm just bad at healing</p>
                <p>and maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed</p>
                <p>which is ironic</p>
                <p>because when I wasn't honest</p>
                <p>I was still being ignored</p>
                <p>Lying for attention</p>
                <p>just to get neglection</p>
                <p>Now we're estranged</p>
