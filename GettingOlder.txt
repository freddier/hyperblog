I'm getting older
I think I'm aging well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself

There's reasons that I'm thankful
There's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door
Which is ironic 
'cause the strangers seem to want me more than anyone before
anyone before... too bad they're usually deranged.

Last week I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story
I make everything sound worse

Can't shake the feeling
that I'm just bad at healing
and maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
which is ironic
because when I wasn't honest
I was still being ignored
Lying for attention
just to get neglection
Now we're estranged
